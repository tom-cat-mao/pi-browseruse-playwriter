    <p>Let your agents control your own Chrome, via CLI or MCP. Your logins, extensions, cookies — already there.</p>
    <br/>
</div>

Other browser MCPs spawn a fresh Chrome — no logins, no extensions, instantly flagged by bot detectors, double the memory. Playwriter connects to **your running browser** instead. One Chrome extension, full Playwright API, everything you're already logged into.

## Installation

1. [**Install Extension**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/playwriter-mcp/jfeammnjpkecdekppnclgkkffahnhfhe) from Chrome Web Store

2. Click extension icon on a tab → turns green when connected

3. Install the CLI and start automating the browser:

   ```bash
   npm i -g playwriter
   playwriter -s 1 -e 'await page.goto("https://example.com")'
   ```

4. Install the skill so your agent knows how to use Playwriter:
   ```bash
   npx -y skills add https://playwriter.dev
   ```

## Quick Start

```bash
playwriter browser start  # starts Chrome for Testing/Chromium with bundled Playwriter extension
playwriter session new  # creates stateful sandbox, outputs session id (e.g. 1)
playwriter -s 1 -e 'await page.goto("https://example.com")'
playwriter -s 1 -e 'console.log(await snapshot({ page }))'
playwriter -s 1 -e 'await page.locator("aria-ref=e5").click()'
```

> **Tip:** Always use single quotes for `-e` to prevent bash from interpreting `$`, backticks, and `\` in your JS code. Use double quotes for strings inside the JS.

## CLI Usage

Each session has **isolated state**. Browser tabs are **shared** across sessions.

```bash
# Browser management
playwriter browser start             # auto-finds Chrome for Testing or Chromium, with recording flags enabled
playwriter browser start /path/to/browser-binary

# Session management
playwriter session new              # creates stateful sandbox, outputs id (e.g. 1)
playwriter session list             # show sessions + state keys
playwriter session reset <id>       # fix connection issues

# Execute (always use -s)
playwriter -s 1 -e 'await page.goto("https://example.com")'
playwriter -s 1 -e 'await page.click("button")'
playwriter -s 1 -e 'console.log(await page.title())'
```

Create your own page to avoid interference from other agents:

```bash
playwriter -s 1 -e 'state.myPage = await context.newPage(); await state.myPage.goto("https://example.com")'
```

Multiline:

```bash
playwriter -s 1 -e $'
const title = await page.title();
console.log({ title, url: page.url() });
'
```

## Examples

Variables in scope: `page`, `context`, `state` (persists between calls), `require`, `importModule`, native `import()`, and Node.js globals. Relative imports resolve from the session working directory.

**Persist data in state:**

```bash
playwriter -e "state.users = await page.$$eval('.user', els => els.map(e => e.textContent))"
playwriter -e "console.log(state.users)"
```

**Intercept network requests:**

```bash
playwriter -e "state.requests = []; page.on('response', r => { if (r.url().includes('/api/')) state.requests.push(r.url()) })"
playwriter -e "await Promise.all([page.waitForResponse(r => r.url().includes('/api/')), page.click('button')])"
playwriter -e "console.log(state.requests)"
```

**Set breakpoints and debug:**

```bash
playwriter -e "state.cdp = await getCDPSession({ page }); state.dbg = createDebugger({ cdp: state.cdp }); await state.dbg.enable()"
playwriter -e "state.scripts = await state.dbg.listScripts({ search: 'app' }); console.log(state.scripts.map(s => s.url))"
playwriter -e "await state.dbg.setBreakpoint({ file: state.scripts[0].url, line: 42 })"
```

**Live edit page code:**

```bash
playwriter -e "state.cdp = await getCDPSession({ page }); state.editor = createEditor({ cdp: state.cdp }); await state.editor.enable()"
playwriter -e "await state.editor.edit({ url: 'https://example.com/app.js', oldString: 'const DEBUG = false', newString: 'const DEBUG = true' })"
```

**Screenshot with labels:**

```bash
playwriter -e "await screenshotWithAccessibilityLabels({ page })"
```

**Live stream a tab to X Live / Twitch (RTMP, runs 24/7):**

```bash
playwriter -s 1 -e "await page.goto('https://example.com')"
playwriter stream start -s 1 --rtmp rtmp://va.pscp.tv:80/x/<stream-key>
playwriter stream status -s 1
playwriter stream stop -s 1
```

## MCP Setup

Using the CLI with the skill (step 4 above) is the recommended approach. For direct MCP server configuration, see [MCP.md](./MCP.md).

## Visual Labels

Vimium-style labels for AI agents to identify elements:

```javascript
await screenshotWithAccessibilityLabels({ page })
// Returns screenshot + accessibility snapshot with aria-ref selectors
await page.locator('aria-ref=e5').click()
```

Color-coded: yellow=links, orange=buttons, coral=inputs, pink=checkboxes, peach=sliders, salmon=menus, amber=tabs.

### vs Built-in Chrome CDP (`--remote-debugging-port`)

|                       | Built-in CDP                          | Playwriter                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Setup                 | Restart Chrome with special flags     | Click extension icon         |
| Confirmation dialog   | Shows automation infobar agents can't dismiss | No blocking dialog   |
| Autonomous agents     | Interrupted by debug banners          | Fully autonomous             |
| User disruption       | Banners appear mid-workflow           | Silent — no interruption     |
| Existing session      | Must relaunch Chrome (lose state)     | Uses your running browser    |

> Chrome's `--remote-debugging-port` flag shows a persistent "controlled by automated software" banner that agents cannot dismiss. It pops up in the middle of your workflow whenever you're using the browser. Playwriter runs silently — agents work autonomously without any confirmation dialogs, so you're never interrupted.

```

## Remote Access

Control Chrome on a remote machine over the internet using [traforo](https://traforo.dev) tunnels:

**On host:**

```bash
npx -y traforo -p 19988 -t my-machine -- npx -y playwriter serve --token <secret>
```

**From remote:**

```bash
export PLAYWRITER_HOST=https://my-machine-tunnel.traforo.dev
export PLAYWRITER_TOKEN=<secret>
playwriter -s 1 -e 'await page.goto("https://example.com")'
```

Also works on a LAN without traforo (`PLAYWRITER_HOST=192.168.1.10`). Full guide with use cases (remote Mac mini, user support, multi-machine control): [docs/remote-access.md](./docs/remote-access.md)

## Security

- **Local only**: WebSocket server on `localhost:19988`
- **Origin validation**: Only our extension IDs allowed (browsers can't spoof Origin)
- **Controlled tab scope**: Tabs are controlled after an extension click. By default, Playwriter also creates a controlled `about:blank` tab when a client connects with no controlled tabs. Set `PLAYWRITER_AUTO_ENABLE=false` to require a manual click.
- **Visible automation**: Chrome shows automation banner on controlled tabs
- **No remote access**: Malicious websites cannot connect

## Playwright API

Connect programmatically (without CLI):

```typescript
import { chromium } from 'playwright-core'
import { startPlayWriterCDPRelayServer, getCdpUrl } from 'playwriter'

const server = await startPlayWriterCDPRelayServer()
const browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP(getCdpUrl())
const page = browser.contexts()[0].pages()[0]

await page.goto('https://example.com')
await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshot.png' })
// Don't call browser.close() - it closes the user's Chrome
server.close()
```

Or connect to a running server:

```bash
npx -y playwriter serve --host 127.0.0.1
```

```typescript
const browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP('http://127.0.0.1:19988')
```

## Troubleshooting

View relay server logs to debug issues:

```bash
playwriter logfile  # prints the log file path
# typically: ~/.playwriter/relay-server.log
```

The relay log contains extension, MCP and WebSocket server logs. A separate CDP JSONL log is also created alongside it (see `playwriter logfile`). Both are recreated on each server start.

Example: summarize CDP traffic counts by direction + method:

```bash
jq -r '.direction + "\t" + (.message.method // "response")' ~/.playwriter/cdp.jsonl | uniq -c
```

## Support

If Playwriter is useful to you, consider [sponsoring the project](https://github.com/sponsors/remorses).

## Known Issues

- If all pages return `about:blank`, restart Chrome (Chrome bug in `chrome.debugger` API)
- Browser may switch to light mode on connect ([Playwright issue](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/37627))
